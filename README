SET_analyses_loop.Rmd is the main file. It has code for all the analyses and plots.
It calls a few functions from within the FUNCTIONS folder, so make sure to get it.

The paths are all absolute and only work on my computer. Make sure you change them according to where you are storing your SET data.
